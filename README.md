<h1 align="center">:moneybag: Bank System Application :bank: </h1>

- It is a mini banking system project that I have created to carry out banking-related transactions. My primary purpose in doing the project is to use the object oriented programming approach in my projects.

- Transactions that can be done in the banking system application:

    <ul>
        <li>Depositing money into the bank account.</li>
        <li>Withdrawing money from your bank account.</li>
        <li>Viewing the balance in the bank account.</li>
        <li>Investing interest.</li>
        <li>To perform cryptocurrency transactions.</li>
    </ul>
